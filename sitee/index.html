            The reason to come here can be very different: be it a business
            meeting, a romantic date, a corporate event or a family holiday - the
            unique atmosphere of nobility, hospitality and kindness will make a
            visit to the "public house" unforgettable. Here everyone is provided
            with a warm, almost homely welcome.

            An atmosphere of ease conducive to relaxation is created by a
            spectacular, but at the same time unobtrusive and eye-pleasing
            interior, designed in a classic style: soft sofas and armchairs,
            massive tables. The decor is dominated by soothing shades of beige and
            brown. You can sit in the main hall or on a low podium. There are also
            three original halls for you, each of which is decorated in a special
            color, with a capacity of up to 150 people.
